# WayTwoCode

For my final WDI project I created WayTwoCode, a website where I've taken pair programming online. The idea was to have a built-in text editor display real-time changes to the file, so users could chat about why or what was written.

## Pain points

One of the biggest struggles for me was that just two weeks before starting this project Google had purchased Firebase and changed the documentation, this meant that if I searched for a solution it usually referred to the legacy documentation which were out of date.
